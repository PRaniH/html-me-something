        <h1>Running a Half While Running on Half</h1>
        <h2>I'll Make a Running Woman Out of You...</h2>
        <h3>Supposedly, We Were All Born to Run</h3>

Back in February 2018, I ran my very first race: the Walt Disney World Princess 5k.

For someone who was unathletic as a child and always picked last, it was a huge accomplishment.

<h2>Friend Like Me... </h2>
<h3>Adventures Are Best Shared with Others</h3>
I enjoyed it so much in fact, my running buddy and I agreed to run it again the next year, 2019.
When it came time to sign up for the 2019 race, we missed the day registrations went live. All the 5k and even 10k slots were sold out. What do we do?</p>
After some frantic texting back and forth, my friend told me she had a solution:
<b>"I went ahead and signed up for the Disney Princess Half Marathon instead, and you should too!"</b>
I was terrified, but excited for the challenged. So I signed up too.
I downloaded a training plan and felt ready to go. 
With 6 months to go until February 2019, this should be do-able, right?

<h2>Poor Unfortunate Souls...</h2>
<h3>You Can't Pull an Overnighter for a Half Marathon</h3>
I would start the running program, then stop. And on and on.
Finally, the holidays came around and I knew there was no way I could cram-train for a 13 mile race less than 2 months away. 
I apologized to my friend that I hadn't been training and was so sorry, but wouldn't be able to do the half marathon with her.</p>
<b>"Let's just walk it! Pretend like you're strolling in Paris. I bet you've easily done 10 miles while on vacation."</b>
She was right. What if we did just walk it?
After double checking pace requirements on the RunDisney website, and confirming that a brisk walk would be enough to avoid the dreaded <a href="http://www.runwalkrepeat.com/2014/01/princess-half-marathon-dont-fear-the-sweepers-or-balloon-ladies/">balloon ladies</a>, we started our training.

It was tough! Our first long walk was 6 miles and it killed me.

Compression socks, kinesthesiology tape, specially fitted shoes from the running store, and epsom salt baths became my best friends.

Amazingly, over the weeks I worked my way up to 8, 10, finally 12 miles. I was a sore mess the days after, but my body could do it.

<h2>How Far I'll Go... </h2>
<h3>13.1 Miles with 1,098,234 of My New Best Friends</h3>
Race weekend in February 2019 came in no time; we headed up to Disney World, picked our bibs, and settled in early at the hotel. Another friend joined us to help watch my son, and yet another friend (<i>an actual runner</i> who runs regularly and doesn't try to cram) joined us last minute to give us encouragement and company on the run.


The morning of the race it was dark out because we were up so early. I was amazed at the thousands of people who were ready and willing to suffer through 13 miles.

<h2>Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho...</h2>
<h3>It's Mile by Mile We Go</h3>

Once we started, I was so excited the miles melted away.

Thank goodness for the fun Disney atmosphere: the magical sights and sounds uplifted me!

<h2>Oh I Just Can't Wait to be Queen...</h2>
<h3>Can You All Just Hurry Up Already?</h3>

By mile 12, I was ready to be done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Cram-training was really cramping my body.</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Instead of giving up, I got another surge of energy. If it wasn't for the 1,098,209 people in the way, I would have ran the fastest I ever have in my life.
I eventually made it with - not against - the crowds and we crossed the finish line!
<h2>I Can Go the Distance...</h2>
<h3>Finish Line!</h3>
It felt like I had won the Olympics or something!

I looked like a tired, sweaty mess... and felt even worse.
<h3><i>It was awesome.</i></h3>

<h3>I can't wait to do another one!</h3>
